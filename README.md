## 1 Ether Everyday

### RULE #1
When the game starts, 1 ether is deposited into the contract. This deposit(with accumulated fees) will be automatically sent to the final beneficiary address after the game ends. Players can change the beneficiary address to their own wallet address freely, by pressing overwrite button. (participating fee : 0.06 eth)
### RULE #2
A new game starts every day, and they generally will end up within 24 hours (5760 blocks) from starting point. The game's ending point is changed to a random point for each game, and no one knows this point. (incl. DEV) There are 100 possible ending points for every game, and their probability distributions are described HERE. Random number provided by trustworthy external oracle (Wolfram alpha) determines where to stop. No one can control it or see it.
### RULE #3
Since 50% of the costs paid are accumulated to the contract account, the amount of money to be received will grow as game proceeded.
### RULE #4
If the beneficiary address has changed during last five minutes before the end of game, the ending time will be automatically extended by 10 minutes. This rule works repeatedly until there's no address update for last 5 minutes.
